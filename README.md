# Coursera: Algorithmic Toolbox

> This repository contains my work from the [Master Algorithmic Programming Techniques Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms) that was created by UC San Diego and delivered through Coursera. I have implemented the solutions in Python3.
